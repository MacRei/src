Go to project1/src/main/java/uga/csx370/mydbimpl/query_evan.java to see my SQL query in java.
I left it in this folder because it was used to implement my query.
It also has the steps I took to figure out how to do my query.
I used the terminal for the code so there is no executable code.
However, if used with uni_in_class DB tables, it will run correctly.
The result can be found under project1/exported_data/query_export_evan.
